## Project Need

Skin is the organ where changes can be first visible so I thought to monitor or detect some skin diseases early on could solve the problem

1. Clone the project into your required folder

2. Install dependencies

3. In your terminal type 

python main.py 

4. Click on the right hand box and upload any image. On clicking the detect button , you will be able to see the prediction


    
## Libraries and Tools Used

- Tensorflow - Constructing the CNN
- Javascript - For image and form handling
- Flask - Used for routing
